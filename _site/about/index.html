<p>The author, Bruce Fogelson, grew up in a very religiously Reformed
suburb, North of Chicago in the 1970s. At that time, the leftist
synagogue did not believe in the ritual of Bar Mitzvah due to the
rejection of contemporary commercialization. Instead they had
confirmation, at 15 or 16, which forced another few years of
Sunday-school.</p>

<p>In a “Semester At Sea” study program in 1982, Fogelson jumped-ship in
Egypt, in order to get to Israel, when the ship refused its itinerary to
dock there due to the Lebanon war with Israel (also called “The First
Lebanon War”). With the war came a boycott of Israel. After harrowing
adventures in Egypt, he escaped, fleeing across the Sinai desert, to
Israel, with a friend. A few days, Fogelson had an actual Bar Mitzvah
just steps from the Wailing Wall—the holiest place in the Jewish
world—at age 20.</p>

<p>In 1983 Fogelson returned to Chicago after college to stumble upon that
same friend, who introduced him to a modern Orthodox synagogue that had
an Orthodox rabbi leading a study group every Tuesday night. With a bit
of help, this Tuesday night study group became the first stepping-stones
to an evolving Jewish life, recognizing all levels of observance. There
were two other Orthodox rabbis over the years who helped Fogelson form a
more spiritual and literal connection with Hebrew study.</p>

<p>After completing his degree in Real Estate and starting his own real
estate development company in 1992, Fogelson became an award-winning and
successful real estate developer, focusing on gentrifying neighborhoods
in Chicago.</p>

<p>Fogelson, who is the first to admit he takes on long-term projects,
filed for several U.S. Patents in 2000 and 2001, which took over a
decade to issue. One is titled “Method and System of creating
Advertising (Ad) books,” and focuses on fundraising for charity.</p>

<p>Fogelson is developing a new business called, LetsSponsor.com and
AdbookAssistant.com that help charity-fundraising by recognizing donors
and sponsors through charity ad-books, online, and in print.</p>

<p>Fogelson lives in Chicago and is married and has three boys.</p>
