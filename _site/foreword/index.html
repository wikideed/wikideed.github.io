    <p>In 2002, I give myself rather long-term tasks; to make this old book I found simple to read. (I take on long-term tasks for myself!). I found a book called The Code Of Jewish Law. For me this was to take this obscure unknown book written in the 1920s with, with all due respect, long - old English and to make it simple, and to find the point in each section that stood out to me. Now, in 2015 I’ve come to realize the book’s significance, so I thought I’d share my project of reducing, what I now know as a great work, into easy to read tasks.</p>

<p>I found the Victorian English translation of <em>The Code of Jewish Law</em> and I had no idea what sort of book it was when I first picked it up or for well over a decade ago. I didn’t know its origins or significance. All I knew was that it was a cross between very old point-by-point instructions pertaining to how one should conduct his or her daily life, reading like a user’s manual. The version I picked up had no reference at all. There was no forward or editors notes. I’ve learned that it was well translated from the work of Solomon Ganzfried who was an Orthodox rabbi and posek best known as an author of <em>Halakha</em> (Jewish law), the <em>Kitzur Shulchan Aruch</em>.</p>

<p>Who wrote down this code of Jewish law?  Its actual name is the <em>Shulchan Aruch</em> (Hebrew: עָרוּך שֻׁלְחָן), which literally translates to “Set Table.” It is also referred to as <em>The Code of Jewish Law</em>. The <em>Shulcan Aruch</em> was written in 1563 by Yosef Karo in Safed, Israel, and published two years later in Venice, Italy. It has been republished and translated countless times.  All I know I found on-line.</p>

<p>The Five Books of Moses are the first five books of the twenty-four books of the Tanakh, together with the oral laws and commentary that form the well-spring of Jewish law and custom. There are The 613 Commandments in the Hebrew Bible; however, they are not directly laid out as <em>do’s</em> and <em>don’ts</em> of day-to-day living. Much of the Jewish liturgy I find to be more original text, commentary or prayer.</p>

<p>I study a bit, with help, but this project I could do all on my own and at my own pace. I began this project on May 15, 2002 (on the occasion of my third son’s 6^th^ birthday) and mostly finished in 2010. In the fall of 2015, thanks to him, I picked it back up and came to realize its origin and significance. Back then I had just decided to make something I found into a more readable-to-modern-times list for me, but by trimming down its four volumes, 221 chapters, and approximately 2,700 rules. There are the same numbers in the same order, just the basic point I derived.</p>

<p>Sure, some of the rules in <em>The Code Of Jewish Law</em> seem outdated—modern times have rendered them obsolete—but, most remain as true today as they have ever been. <em>The Code of Jewish Law</em> can be viewed as instructions, as opposed to doctrine. The list of day-to-day tasks and prohibitions seem endless. However, the list that comprises <em>The Code of Jewish Law</em> comes from a recognized and universally accepted source.   Much of my source came from on-line searches.</p>

<p>Let’s be perfectly clear . . . That source is not me! It should be
argued that there is always something lost in translation. This is
even more the case in this instance. I am absolutely no authority, I
was an average student, I can read NO Hebrew, I checked with no one
and, I have no way of knowing if I translated or reduced it well. I
took what I saw and made it an easier for me read.</p>

<p>It is a book of deeds and I simply took it as a task to make it
simple. Some things simply seem worth doing; not all things need
knowing.</p>

<p>In this case, that is the point.</p>
