</p>
<p>
    1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Realize each day that you are in the presence of G-d and be mindful of His precepts.
</p>
<p>
    1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wake up worshiping Him and prepare yourself to minister to the world with all your heart all day.
</p>
<p>
    1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you wake from sleep, rise quickly to be ready to serve the Creator before an evil inclination has an opportunity to overcome you, or before you
    decide not to rise at all.
</p>
<p>
    1.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even when you find it difficult to wake up early, do not make an excuse to stay in bed.
</p>
<p>
    1.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may perform the midnight service after midnight. You may also study Torah after midnight. Always rise early enough to have time to prepare for and
    go to synagogue for prayer with the congregation.
</p>
<p>
    1.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Psalms and other portions of the Torah must not be spoken by heart, even by one well-versed in them. However, a blind man is permitted to recite
    Scripture by heart.
</p>
<p>
    1.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try to abstain from benedictions that include G-d’s name in them; say, “Blessed be Thou,” instead of, “Thou, O Lord.”
</p>

<p>
    <a href="#top">Back to top ^</a><p class="volume-header"><a id="2" href="/#2">Chapter 2 – Laws Related to Washing Your Hands in the Morning</a></p>
</p>
<p>
    2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not go far before washing each morning.
</p>
<p>
    2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put on fringes upon rising. Do not walk more than four cubits (about six feet) without fringes. And, if you haven’t washed your hands, you must not say
    the benediction while putting your first garment on.
</p>
<p>
    2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the morning, wash in the following manner: Spill water with your left hand onto your right hand, and then reverse this process three times for each
    side. Wash your hands up to your wrists. Next, wash your face in honor of the Creator “for in the image of G-d has he made the man.” Rinse your mouth
    because you must only mention the great Name in purity and cleanliness. Dry both your hands and face carefully.
</p>
<p>
    2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Water used for washing must not be used for any other purpose because the evil spirit rests in it. Dispose of it away from others.
</p>
<p>
    2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before your morning hand-washing, you must not touch your mouth, nose, eyes, ears, anus, any kind of food, or any place where a vein is open because
    the evil spirit rests on your hands and is injurious to such places until they are washed.
</p>
<p>
    2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful to wash with clean water drawn with personal care. In case of emergency, you are permitted to wash your hands out of any vessel and in any
    kind of water, such as from a river or with melted snow. If water is not available, wipe your hands three times and say the benediction for cleansing (not
    washing) the hands. Afterwards, when water is found, wash your hands, but do not repeat the benediction.
</p>
<p>
    2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Expel excrement and urine first thing each morning. Since most people take care of this shortly after rising, the best order to accomplish your
    hand-washing is: wash, use the bathroom, wash again, and say the proper blessings at the second washing.
</p>
<p>
    2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you get up at night, should wash and then stay awake until dawn. Should you fall back asleep, or sleep about half an hour during the day, it is not
    necessary to wash your hands again; but, if you wash three times (as described above) do not pronounce the benediction.
</p>
<p>
    2.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should wash after: a) waking from sleep, b) leaving the bathroom, c) cutting your nails, d) cutting or combing your hair, e) taking off your shoes,
    f) copulating, g) touching vermin, h) leaving a cemetery or leaving the dead, i) bloodletting, and j) touching private areas of your body.

    <a href="#top">Back to top ^</a><p class="volume-header"><a id="3" href="/#3">Chapter 3 – Laws Related to Dressing and Manner of Walking</a></p>
</p>
<p>
    3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should be modest. “And to walk humbly with thy G-d.” Be modest and do not expose yourself while dressing (even in private, for you are always
    visible to G-d).
</p>
<p>
    3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not walk like non-Jews. Don’t be proud and haughty; rather, be modest and humble.
</p>
<p>
    3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don’t wear clothes that are expensive, common, or dirty. Wear moderately-priced, clean clothes.
</p>
<p>
    3.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When putting on your clothes and shoes, start from your right side; when taking off your clothes and shoes, start with your left side. For lacing, do
    the opposite, following the similar order as for <em>tefillin </em>(phylacteries).
</p>
<p>
    3.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not put on two garments at the same time, so as not to forget to focus on what you are doing.
</p>
<p>
    3.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should cover your head. Do not walk four cubits (about six feet), nor speak with your head uncovered.
</p>
<p>
    3.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not walk haughtily. Walk in a moderate manner. Walk in a way that enables you to see who is coming, and observe your steps.
</p>
<p>
    3.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not walk between: a) two women, b) two dogs, or c) two pigs. And do not allow them to walk between two men.
</p>

</p>
<p>
    4.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should go to the bathroom habitually both in the morning and evening to gain better alertness and cleanliness. If you defer defecation or urination
    at will, you violate the law’s warning against being “abominable” and risk being “barren.”
</p>
<p>
    4.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Practice modesty when you enter a bathroom and do not expose yourself more than is necessary. Avoid others in the bathroom, or, at least turn aside,
    when others are present.
</p>





<p>
    4.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not stand or strain yourself while relieving yourself. And do not leave the bathroom before you are sure you are finished. Be careful not to
    sprinkle urine on your clothes or shoes. Avoid holding your member.
</p>
<p>
    4.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thinking of Torah is prohibited while relieving yourself. Concentrate on the business at hand, or find another distraction to avoid thoughts that may
    violate these laws.
</p>
<p>
    4.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wipe yourself thoroughly with your left hand.
</p>
<p>
    4.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After each defecation or urination (even one drop), you must wash your hands and say the benediction <em>Asher yatzar</em>.

    <a href="#top">Back to top ^</a><p class="volume-header"><a id="5" href="/#5">Chapter 5 – Laws Regarding Cleanliness of the Place for Holy Purposes</a>
</p></p></p>
<p>
    5.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cover excrement before engaging in holy matters such as reading, prayer, study, etc.
</p>
<p>
    5.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not pray or meditate on holy matters where excrement or foul odor exists. (You can rinse away urine.)
</p>
<p>
    5.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not engage in holy matters if there is any excrement on your body—even though it may be slight or covered.
</p>
<p>
    5.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When in doubt as to the cleanliness of the place for holy purposes, take care not to utter anything holy until the area is examined.
</p>
<p>
    5.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep away from the excrement of an infant.
</p>
<p>
    5.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Distance yourself from excrement of a human, a cat, a marten, or a red cock. You are not bound to keep far away from excrement of any other animal or
    bird because they do not ordinarily produce a bad odor. Stay away from any excrement that has a bad odor.
</p>
<p>
    5.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry excrement that crumbles is considered like earth if it no longer has an odor.
</p>
<p>
    5.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay four cubits (about six feet) from a smell’s end.
</p>
<p>
    5.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If excrement is discovered in a house where people pray with a congregation, stop praying until the excrement is removed or covered.
</p>
<p>
    5.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you prayed somewhere because there was no smell and you did not examine the area as you should have done, and later find excrement or odor there,
    your prayer is considered to have been like the sacrifice of the wicked. It is abominable, and you must pray again after taking care of the situation.
    Consult the source on this point.
</p>
<p>
    5.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a bad odor goes forth from someone, that person is not permitted to engage in holy matters until the odor disappears; the same applies for odor
    emanating from a neighbor.
</p>
<p>
    5.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay away from the bathroom, even though it may be clean and the excrement removed when engaging in holy purposes.
</p>
<p>
    5.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stay away from any vessel used for the collection of excrement (even though the container may not smell or has been washed) when engaging in holy
    purposes.
</p>
<p>
    5.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the bathhouse, do not speak or meditate about any holy matter.
</p>
<p>
    5.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not discuss matters of Torah or express anything holy in the presence of exposed genitals.
</p>
<p>
    5.16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a woman, the area forbidden to be exposed is any body part that is a hands-breadth (about three inches) away from any portion of her body
    considered a genital area.
</p>
<p>
    5.17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a man, if his genital organs are exposed or his breast is exposed, he is considered uncovered.

    <a href="#top">Back to top ^</a><p class="volume-header"><a id="6" href="/#6">Chapter 6 – Laws Related to Benedictions, etc.</a>
</p></p></p>
<p>
    6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before uttering a benediction, you must ascertain which benediction you need to say so that when you mention G-d’s name, you are aware of the
    benediction’s conclusion. You must not engage in any other activity when uttering a benediction and you must not utter it in a habitual manner.
</p>
<p>
    6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When uttering benedictions, your mouth must be free from everything (including saliva).
</p>
<p>
    6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not mention the name of G-d in vain.
</p>
<p>
    6.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not create an occasion where you feel the need to mention G-d’s name in vain. If you utter it accidently, then follow the utterance by saying,
    “blessed be His name for ever and ever.” Or say, “teach me Thy statutes.”
</p>
<p>
    6.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After speaking a benediction over water, if you become aware of a recent death near the water, precaution would dictate throwing the water out;
    however, you should first taste some of the water so that the benediction is not in vain. Drink a little of the water and then spill out the balance so as
    not to waste the prayer.
</p>
<p>
    6.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are in doubt as to whether or not you said any of the benedictions (except Grace), you are not bound to repeat them.
</p>
<p>
    6.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to a law enacted by King David, you should say at least 100 benedictions per day. The numerical value of certain blessings equals 100, or
    nearly 100. Review these to comply with this law.
</p>
<p>
    6.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you hear a neighbor saying benedictions, you must say, “blessed be He and blessed be His name” on hearing the Name and you must say, “amen” at the
    conclusion. “Amen” means “it is true” and when you say, “amen,” you should have sincere agreement in your mind.
</p>
<p>
    6.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some blessings are not to be interrupted. Refer to the source for details.
</p>
<p>
    6.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be careful to say “amen” correctly, not too quickly, not before the end of the benediction, not too far after the benediction, and not louder than the
    reader.
</p>
<p>
    6.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need not respond with “amen” after your own reading or benediction, or even if you end the same benediction in unison with a reader. (There are a
    few exceptions to this law. See source for details, or consult a rabbi.)

<p>
    7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Saying “amen” to the benediction “to engage in the study of the Torah” is a debatable topic. (See source for details, or consult a rabbi.)
</p>
<p>
    7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not say the morning benediction, “He that gives the cock understanding,” until daylight.
</p>
<p>
    7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A blind person may say the benediction, “He that opens the eyes of the blind,” since he is helped by others.
</p>
<p>
    7.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the benediction, “He that removes sleep from my eyes and slumber from my eyelids,” do not respond “amen”; instead, respond with “and may it be
    Thy will.”
</p>
<p>
    7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are awake all night, you must say all the morning benedictions except, “for the washing of the hands.” It is doubtful whether you have to say
    any other benedictions except for this one, but you may choose to be zealous, and respond “amen” to others.
</p>
<p>
    7.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not say all benedictions before prayers, you may say the benedictions after prayers, except “for the washing of the hands” (see 7.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;above).

<p>
    8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As soon as dawn arrives, you are not permitted to begin any work, commence doing business, or start a journey until after you have prayed.
    “[R]ighteousness shall go before Him; and he shall make its footsteps a way to walk in.”
</p>
<p>
    8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not eat or drink before prayers. However, if you need to eat for health reasons, you may eat.
</p>
<p>
    8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some hold that even if you wake at midnight, you should not eat before prayers.
</p>
<p>
    8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are permitted to drink water, tea, or coffee without sugar before prayers because to do so is considered without haughtiness.
</p>
<p>
    8.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not greet, visit or even say good morning to a neighbor before prayers. You should salute or greet <em>Hashem</em> before greeting another man.
    Salutes or greetings are permitted before you pray, if you alter the fashion of the greeting so that it is diminished before G-d.
</p>
<p>
    8.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not study before prayers.

</p></p>
<p>
    9.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Observe and apply the precept of fringes.
</p>
<p>
    9.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Varying opinions abound on the make and quality of threads permitted to be used for fringes of different lengths.
</p>
<p>
    9.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules govern the placement of the threads in relationship to the corners of your garment, so be sure that the fringes are attached at the corners of
    your garment.
</p>
<p>
    9.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your fringes rip or look worn, you may allow the threads to remain on your garment since the law requires you “to make fringes upon the corners.”
    Even so, keeping your fringes in good repair is the best practice.
</p>
<p>
    9.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Threads of fringes should be tied and knotted in a particular manner.
</p>
<p>
    9.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fringes must be put on in a lawful, proper, and orderly manner.
</p>
<p>
    9.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examine the threads, knots and spacing of fringes before putting on the <em>talith</em> (prayer shawl), unless you are running late and would miss
    prayer while checking them.
</p>
<p>
    9.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prior to putting on the <em>talith</em>, you should say the benediction and then put it on without interruption. Take the <em>talith</em> in both
    hands, and being mindful of what you are doing, place it over your head. Be careful not to let the threads drag on the ground.
</p>
<p>
    9.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <em>talith</em> benediction is said during daytime only, not at night. In addition, rules regarding order, large, and small <em>talith</em> as well
    as times of day to put them on require adherence. See source, or consult a rabbi for details.
</p>
<p>
    9.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you take off the <em>talith</em> for just a moment (e.g.., to go to the bathroom), you need not repeat the prayer upon putting it back on.
    Exceptions exist for when accidents occur, or if you are praying.
</p>
<p>
    9.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the <em>talith</em> belonging to another is permissible, even without that person’s permission, for prayer. The presumption is that the owner
    is willing to allow his <em>talith</em> to be used so that the precept of the requirement of a <em>talith</em> for prayer is abided by so long as no loss
    on his part occurs. However, different rules govern the borrowing or using of the synagogue’s <em>talith</em>.
</p>
<p>
    9.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules govern the type of wool and other material used to make a <em>talith</em>.
</p>
<p>
    9.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules govern the threads and thread-breadths to be used to make a <em>talith</em>.
</p>
<p>
    9.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“The threads of the fringes must be twisted, and if any threads became untwisted, the untwisted part is then considered as entirely cut off and as out
    of existence.”
</p>
<p>
    9.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules govern how to treat garments that come apart.
</p>
<p>
    9.16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the corner of the <em>talith</em> (prayer shawl) is either cut off or torn off, and if it is a small area, you can sew it back together or piece
    together fabric to replace the missing area.
</p>
<p>
    9.17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules govern the distance of the entire space of the corner where it is suitable to put fringes.
</p>
<p>
    9.18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rules govern how you receive permission to replace or upgrade fringes to the <em>talith</em>.
</p>
<p>
    9.19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be respectful when disposing of errant fringes.
</p>
<p>
9.20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone who neglects the <em>talith</em> is guilty of violating a positive law of the Torah, and must do service. If you are scrupulous in your care of    <em>talith</em>, you are worthy of beholding the Divine Presence.

    <a href="#top">Back to top ^</a><p class="volume-header"><a id="10" href="/#10">Chapter 10 – Laws of <em>Tefillin</em> (Phylacteries)</a>
</p></p>
<p>
    10.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Precepts regarding the <em>tefillin</em> (phylacteries) are important because the Torah is compared to the <em>tefillin</em>. The <em>tefillin</em>
    represents your willingness to subjugate your body in worship. Consequently, you must not put on defective <em>tefillin</em>.
</p>
<p>
10.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put on <em>tefillin</em> in the morning “as soon as you would be able to recognize a neighbor from four cubits [about six feet] away.”    <em>Tefillin</em> are put on after <em>talith</em> (prayer shawl) since <em>talith</em> (fringes) are worn all the time and <em>tefillin</em> are worn only
    sometimes; constant articles are donned before occasional ones.
</p>
<p>
    10.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear <em>tefillin</em> on the left, next to the heart. According to Rabbis as well as tradition, the head <em>tefillin</em> is worn above the eyes
    even though Scripture specifies “between the eyes.” Proper placement of the <em>tefillin</em> on the head is important. (See source for details, or consult
    a rabbi.)
</p>
<p>
    10.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put on <em>tefillin</em> while standing. <em>Tefillin</em> must be taken out of its bag by hand, not shaken out or dumped out. Put on the hand first,
    and before tightening, say, “to put on the <em>tefillin</em>,” next tighten, making coils around the arm. Place the head piece on, and before tightening,
    say, “concerning the commandment of <em>tefillin</em>.” Then tighten and say the blessing: “Blessed be His glorious kingdom from everlasting to
    everlasting.” Whether to say these words out loud or not is controversial.
</p>
<p>
    10.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Put away or ignore the head piece of <em>tefillin</em> so you can first attend to the hand <em>tefillin</em>, as it is written “and thou shalt bind
    for a sign upon thy HAND and they shall be as frontlets between thy EYES.”
</p>
<p>
    10.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing should be between your skin and the <em>tefillin</em>; neither the head piece nor the hand piece. Even long, over-grown hair is considered an
    obstruction to proper placement of the head <em>tefillin</em>.
</p>
<p>
    10.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not allow the knot of the hand <em>tefillin</em> to shift. The knot should always be facing your heart. The bridge in the strap must be inserted
    and must face upward, with the capsule facing downward. For left-handed people, refer to the details given for the right-hand <em>tefillin</em>.
</p>
<p>
    10.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under no circumstances are you permitted to allow interruption or distraction when you are donning the <em>tefillin</em>, during or between putting on
    the hand and head <em>tefillin</em>.
</p>
<p>
    10.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in error, someone interrupts you, you should touch the <em>tefillin</em> on your hand and repeat the benedictions.
</p>
<p>
    10.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you put on the <em>tefillin </em>(phylacteries), reflect on the Holy One, unity, the exodus, and G-d’s miracles to become mindful of the
    Creator, and restrain sinful pleasures.
</p>
<p>
    10.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have only the head piece or only the hand piece, put it on and say the benediction for that piece.
</p>
<p>
    10.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are left-handed, put the <em>tefillin</em> on your right hand, using the same procedure as for a right-handed person, but perform the process
    backwards.
</p>
<p>
    10.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The width of the straps of the head piece and the hand piece should be no longer than the length of barley, and should reach down to a man’s navel,
    or a bit above.
</p>
<p>
10.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the black side of the straps face outward. If the straps become inverted, you must redeem yourself by fasting or giving charity. If the    <em>tefillin</em> falls to the ground outside its bag, you must fast.
</p>
<p>
    10.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you remove the <em>tefillin</em> to go to the bathroom, you must repeat the benediction upon putting them on again.
</p>
<p>
    10.16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When wearing the <em>tefillin</em>, be attentive and do not eat or sleep. You may partake of a snack though.
</p>
<p>
    10.17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Touch the <em>tefillin</em> when you think of them to not be distracted from them.
</p>
<p>
    10.18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The <em>tefillin</em> for the head is more sacred than that for the hand, so do not use a strap from the hand piece for the head piece. You may use a
    strap from the head piece for the hand piece though. Do not use the <em>tefillin</em> bag for a secular purpose.
</p>
<p>
    10.19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not take off the <em>tefillin</em> until after reciting, “may it be Thy will, O Lord, that we keep Thy statutes.”
</p>
<p>
    10.20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove the <em>tefillin</em> while standing, immediately after you are through praying. Do not take off the hand piece before taking off the head
    piece.
</p>
<p>
    10.21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Place the <em>tefillin</em> in the bag in such a way as to ensure that the following day the hand piece is removed before the head piece.
</p>
<p>
    10.22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you arrive at synagogue without <em>tefillin</em>, after the congregation has started praying, wait until the end of the service to borrow one and
    then pray. Do not put the <em>tefillin</em> on at night.
</p>
<p>
    10.23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not wear the <em>tefillin</em> if you will become soiled due to diarrhea or an illness.
</p>
<p>
    10.24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a minor son who is capable of taking proper care of his <em>tefillin</em>, provide him with one.
</p>
<p>
    10.25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Follow the custom of the community you are in when wearing the <em>tefillin </em>(phylacteries) on Intermediate Days of a festival.
</p>
<p>
    10.26&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examine your <em>tefillin</em> to make sure it is clean.

</p></p>
<p>
    11.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affix a <em>mezuzah</em> (small, prayer scrolls rolled up to place on doorways, entryways, and gates) to every door of your house.
</p>
<p>
    11.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affix <em>mezuzot</em> to every gate of the courts, the alleys, the cities and the provinces of your community.
</p>
<p>
    11.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affix <em>mezuzah </em>to the right-hand side of the door’s entryway.
</p>
<p>
    11.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be guided by the side where the door hinges are when attaching a mezuzah on doors, which are positioned side-by-side.
</p>
<p>
    11.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affix <em>mezuzah</em> within the upper-third part of the door-post, in the upper one-third of the door.
</p>
<p>
    11.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Roll the end of the parchment from the end of the sentence to the beginning, so that the word “<em>Shema</em>” is on the top. Fasten it diagonally on
    the door-post, with nails, with the first word facing toward the house and the last line facing outward.
</p>
<p>
    11.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Say the benediction before placing the <em>mezuzah</em> on a door-post.
</p>
<p>
    11.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Affix a mezuzah to both the big gate to your house and the small door by which people enter and leave.
</p>
<p>
    11.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are concerned that someone will steal your <em>mezuzah</em>, make a groove in the door-post and place the <em>mezuzah</em> in the groove, or
    place it in the inside of the house, behind the door on the door-post, not the wall.
</p>
<p>
    11.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All houses more than four cubits square (six feet square) must have a <em>mezuzah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    11.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only doors that have two door-posts at least ten hand-breaths (about 30 inches) apart with a lintel require a <em>mezuzah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    11.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doors with no lintel above sometimes require a <em>mezuzah </em>(small, prayer scrolls rolled up to place on doorways, entryways, and gates); refer
    to the source for specifics.
</p>
<p>
    11.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opinions vary as to whether an entrance with no door requires a mezuzah.
</p>
<p>
    11.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A temporary residence does not require a <em>mezuzah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    11.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A three-wall corridor does not require a <em>mezuzah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    11.16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gate houses, small huts, porches, attics, garden huts, and sheds do not require <em>mezuzot</em>.
</p>
<p>
    11.17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bath-houses, canneries and purification shelters do not require <em>mezuzot </em>(small, prayer scrolls rolled up to place on doorways, entryways,
    and gates).
</p>
<p>
    11.18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>Mezuzah</em> where children are, or in bathrooms, should be covered.
</p>
<p>
    11.19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A house where non-Jews and Jews reside does not require a <em>mezuzah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    11.20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cellar where the door lies on the ground does not require a <em>mezuzah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    11.21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you rent a house outside of Israel, you do not need a <em>mezuzah</em>.
</p>
<p>
    11.22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you sell your house, do not remove the <em>mezuzot</em> when you leave. Include the cost of the <em>mezuzot</em> in the price of the house.
</p>
<p>
    11.23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure you observe the precept of <em>mezuzah</em> so that when you leave and return to your house, you are confronted with His name.
</p>
<p>
    11.24&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kiss the <em>mezuzah</em> when you leave and enter your house, but do not put your hand upon it.
</p>
<p>
    11.25&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Examine the <em>mezuzah</em> of your private dwelling twice every seven years; examine the ones on public buildings twice every fifty years.

    12.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wear a sash to pray in communities where this is custom.
</p>
<p>
    12.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Give charity before praying.
</p>
<p>
    12.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the bathroom before praying or reading the Torah.
</p>
<p>
    12.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is better to pray after <em>Shema</em> (three portions of the Holy Scriptures in Deuteronomy and Numbers; one of only two prayers that are
    specifically commanded in Torah) if you think you might have an accident during the reading, or have to go to the bathroom.
</p>
<p>
    12.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wash your hands to the wrists before praying.
</p>
<p>
    12.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you have washed your hands in the morning, if you are not sure they are clean, wash again before praying.
</p>
<p>
    12.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make every effort to join in prayer with the congregation rather than pray alone.
</p>
<p>
    12.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are traveling, you should attempt to join a congregation in prayer if the congregation is four miles or less from your destination. But you
    must be able to reach the place of prayer before nighttime.
</p>
<p>
    12.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is preferable that you pray in a synagogue or in the House of Study, as these are sacred places.
</p>
<p>
    12.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should select a regular place of worship and a permanent seat at that place.
</p>
<p>
    12.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should rush to go to the synagogue for worship, but linger outside so as not to enter without awe and trembling.
</p>
<p>
    12.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are unable to attend your regular place of worship to pray, gather ten men and have a communal service at home.
</p>
<p>
    12.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are ill or have a weak heart, you may eat earlier at home before going to synagogue to pray.
</p>
<p>
12.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not stand in the same spot as a <em>minyan</em> (a quorum of ten male adults) to pray immediately after he has prayed, even if you are a    <em>minyan</em>.
</p>

    21.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you miss the time of prayer to prevent a monetary loss or because you are too intoxicated, it is considered a mishap and you may make up the

</p>
<p>
    21.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can make up an omitted prayer immediately following the service, or you may skip them; if two periods are missed, make up only the last one.
</p>
<p>
    21.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can make up the Morning Prayer after the afternoon service has concluded.
</p>
<p>
    21.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can make up an omitted prayer only after you have offered the current prayer.
</p>
<p>
    21.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The version of the complementary prayer must be the same as the complementary current prayer. For more detail, see the source.

<p>
    26.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is customary for a mourner to say <em>kaddish </em>(a hymn of praises to G-d), to act as the <em>maftir</em> (the last person called up to the
    Torah on Shabbat and holiday mornings) and the <em>hazan </em>(cantor of a synagogue).
</p>
<p>
    26.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mourner is entitled to say all the <em>kaddish</em> during the first seven days of mourning.
</p>
<p>
    26.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For rules involving the presence of y<em>ahrzeit</em> (memorial for the death of a loved one) and a mourner, see source for details.
</p>
<p>
    26.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A minor and an adult and an observer of <em>yahrzeit</em> have the same rights to say <em>kaddish</em>.
</p>
<p>
    26.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person observing <em>yahrzeit</em> and a mourner observing the first 30 days of mourning have precedent over mourners observing the rest of the year
    of mourning.
</p>
<p>
    26.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person observing <em>yahrzeit</em> is less favored than someone observing the first 30 days of mourning.
</p>
<p>
    26.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast lots for mourners of the equal rights.
</p>
<p>
    26.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A resident mourner has preference over a stranger; but there are exceptions. See the source.
</p>
<p>
    26.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers observing thirty days of mourning and residents observing the rest of the year hold equal rights.
</p>
<p>
    26.10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A resident observing <em>yahrzeit</em> and a stranger observing thirty days of mourning will each say portions of the <em>kaddish</em>.
</p>
<p>
    26.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strangers observing the rest of the year of mourning are entitled to one <em>kaddish</em>, when residents are doing the same.
</p>
<p>
    26.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A resident is someone who resides permanently in the community, even if he does not pay taxes. However, someone who pays taxes, but does not reside
    in the community is also considered a resident.
</p>
<p>
    26.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mourners may forbid a visiting mourner from saying <em>kaddish</em> (a hymn of praises to G-d) at their synagogue if the mourner has a regular place
    of worship or House of Study.

    26.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lots should be cast to determine who says <em>kaddish</em> when two or more mourners present are competent to act as <em>hazan</em>.
</p>
<p>
    26.16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are mourning the loss of your father and mother, you do not have any special rights to say <em>kaddish</em> (a hymn of praises to G-d) before
    any other mourner.
</p>
<p>
    26.17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not say <em>kaddish</em> longer than eleven months for the death of a parent.
</p>
<p>
    26.18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When many mourners are present, two or three may say <em>kaddish</em> together.
</p>
<p>
    26.19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If no mourners are in the synagogue, a person without a father or mother will say <em>kaddish</em>.
</p>
<p>
    26.20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daughters should not say <em>kaddish</em>.
</p>
<p>
    26.21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are unable to say <em>kaddish</em> on the day you observe <em>Jahrzeit</em>, you should say it at the <em>Maariv</em> (Jewish prayer service
    held in evening or night) service.
</p>
<p>
    26.22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is more important for a child to be righteous and behave properly than say <em>kaddish</em> to honor his parent.

</p>
<p>
    44.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are in doubt as to whether you have said Grace or not, say it again anyway.

</p>
<p>
    45.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cup used for Grace must not be broken.
</p>
<p>
    45.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a <em>Kohen</em> (priest) is present, allow him to lead the saying of Grace.
</p>
<p>
    45.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those leading in saying Grace, should begin with, “let us say Grace.”

</p>
<p>
    45.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When a group of people unite to eat, they must say Grace together as a unit.
</p>
<p>
    45.16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If three males eat together, and one of the three says Grace in private, the rest must say Grace anyway.
</p>
<p>
    45.17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If three males eat together and two of them wish to say Grace before the third is finished, the third should interrupt his meal to join the other two
    in saying Grace.
</p>
<p>
    45.18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a large banquet, it is appropriate to ask someone to lead in Grace.
</p>
<p>
    45.19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All those present at a meal that can see each other, even if in different rooms of a house, should say Grace together.
</p>
<p>
    45.20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if you are not eating and hear others who are saying Grace, you should respond accordingly. (See source for details, or consult a rabbi.)
</p>
<p>
    45.21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regardless of where you get your bread, you should say Grace with all who you are eating bread with.
</p>
<p>
    45.22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Women present with men who are united in saying Grace should listen to its recital.
</p>
<p>
    45.23&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do not read the <em>Shema</em> (three portions of the Holy Scriptures in Deuteronomy and Numbers; one of only two prayers that are
    specifically commanded in Torah) morning and evening, or publicly violate the Divine Commands, you may not be counted with those united in saying Grace.

    51.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consult an authority for determining if you should read <em>Shebarata</em> in the concluding benediction of Bore <em>nefashot rabbot</em>.
</p>
<p>
    51.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have said benedictions that included the three blessings over your fruit and then eat more, you should only recite the benediction embodying
    the three blessings.
</p>
<p>
    51.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not leave the place where you are eating to engage in another activity until you have said the concluding benediction.
</p>
<p>
    51.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you neglect to say the concluding benediction immediately after eating, say it before digestion begins.

    195.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the rend near the front of the neck of your garment.
</p>
<p>
    195.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rending your garments for a mother or father is different than for other relatives. See the source for details.
</p>
<p>
    195.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make the rend on the right side of your garment for all relatives; make it on the left for your parents.
</p>
<p>
    195.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rend your garment with your hands or an instrument for a relative; with only your hand for your parents.
</p>
<p>
    195.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the seven days of mourning, you need not make a rend every time you change garments; for parents, you must rend your garments each time you
    change clothes.
</p>
<p>
    195.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You may baste together the rend in the case of a relative’s death after seven days. And completely sew it up after thirty days. For a parent, you may
    baste it after thirty days and never completely sew it up.
</p>
<p>
    195.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you hear of a relative’s death after thirty days, you do not need to rend your garments; for a parent, rend your garment whenever you hear about
    their death.
</p>
<p>
    195.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The intervention of a festival cancels the rending rules for death.
</p>
<p>
    195.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If another death occurs within the first seven days of mourning, you should rend your garments a second time. (See source for details, or consult a
    rabbi.)
</p>
<p>
    195.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you hear of more than one death, you may rend your garment once. However if one death is of a parent, you must rend your garment twice.
</p>
<p>
    195.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A sick person is exempt from rending his garments on the death of a relative.

</p>
<p>
    196.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any person who lost a relative for whom his is bound to observe mourning rites is called an <em>onan</em> (a person who is bound to observe mourning)
    until after the interment.
</p>
<p>
    196.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An <em>onan</em> is exempt for all the precepts of the Torah.
</p>
<p>
    196.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <em>onan</em> has eaten before the internment and the food was not yet digested after the interment, he should recite Grace.
</p>
<p>
    196.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the <em>onan</em> is out of town, he is exempt from observing the rules relating to the <em>onan</em>.
</p>
<p>
    196.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a place where you use a burial society, you are exempt from the rules relating to the <em>onan</em>.
</p>
<p>
    196.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the interment, a mourner does not remove his shoes, and may leave the house to plan the funeral.
</p>
<p>
    196.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The recitation of the <em>Shema</em> and the <em>Shemoneh esreh</em> (eighteen; silent prayer)should be read by the <em>onan</em> even if the time to
    do so has passed.
</p>
<p>
    196.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you become an <em>onan</em> when the time for reciting the morning, the afternoon, or the evening service has begun you need not make amends if
    you omit prayers.
</p>
<p>
    196.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the death occurs on a Sabbath, the mourner is not subject to the laws of an <em>onan</em>.
</p>
<p>
    196.9&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards evening, the <em>onan</em> reads the <em>Shema</em>.
</p>
<p>
    196.11&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a mourner must walk up to the Sabbath boundary to attend to burial preparations, he becomes an <em>onan</em> as soon as he begins to walk.
</p>
<p>
    196.12&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A mourner must pray the <em>Minhah</em> (prayers offered in the afternoon) service for a death that occurs on a Friday.
</p>
<p>
    196.13&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a mourner decides to bury the person on the first day of a festival, he becomes subject to the laws of an <em>onan</em>.
</p>
<p>
    196.14&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One, whose dead relative lies before him on the night of the second day of a festival, when in a community where the custom prevails to bury the
    dead by Jews, becomes subject to the laws of an <em>onan</em>.
</p>
<p>
    196.15&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you become an <em>onan</em> at the termination of a festival, you may recite the <em>havdalah</em> on the day after the festival.
</p>
<p>
    196.16&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If an <em>onan</em> has a son to be circumcised, he should attend to the burial before the circumcision.
</p>
<p>
    196.17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the eve of the fourteenth of <em>Nisan </em>(first month of the Jewish year), an <em>onan</em> should employ an agent to look for leaven.
</p>
<p>
    196.18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you become an <em>onan</em> on a night when the <em>omer</em> is counted should count the <em>omer</em> at night.
</p>
<p>
    196.19&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a man dies in prison and the officer refuses to release the body without pay, the laws of <em>onan</em> and mourners do not apply.
</p>
<p>
    196.20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where burial is forbidden before the expiration of forty-eight hours, the mourners are subject to the laws of <em>onan</em>.
</p>
<p>
    196.21&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the relatives of a dead person fear that they will be unable to have the body cleansed after the two days of expiration, after having the body
    cleansed immediately, and put the body in a coffin, the law of the <em>onan</em> ceases.
</p>
<p>
    196.22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A person responsible for the burial of a dead relative should be told immediately.
