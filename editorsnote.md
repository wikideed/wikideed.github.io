I had no idea when I embarked upon this project that it would touch me
so deeply. I was raised Jewish, had a Bat Mitzvah, and celebrated the
Jewish holidays. When I was approached to put *The Code of Jewish Law*
into a pleasant format, I thought, “Sure, why not,” without realizing
it would have such a profound impact.
 
When reading through the chapters and corresponding Commandments and
laws, I found that many made sense. Certainly, some did not apply to
the 21^st^ century any longer; however, I was surprised by my reaction
in thinking that a significant number appeared quite logical.
 
*The Code of Jewish Law* is a list. But it is also so much more. It is
a reminder how to comport oneself. It entails respect, kindness, and
prayer. As I always say, take what works!
 
Please remember that if you have any questions as to the verity of any
particular point, consult a rabbi or see the source book.
 
*The Code of Jewish Law* was retranslated and constructed using modern
vernacular. When anything is translated, by definition, something
changes from its original form. That said, it is my humble opinion
that the words that follow capture the essence conveyed in the
original Commandments and Jewish laws, but again, I am no expert.
 
As I am no expert, nor is the author / compiler of this project, you
will find the words *See source for details, or consult a rabbi* in
parentheses, and after a directive that may be unclear to the reader.
So, if you are interested in delving into the depths of Jewish law, we
urge you to do exactly that.
 
I have found in my life that anything learned is a success. This
project has taught me many things. Its respective success is already
in the proverbial books.
 
May you enjoy *The Code of Jewish Law* in good health!
