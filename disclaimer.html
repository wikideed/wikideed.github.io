<p><i>The Code of Jewish Law Redux</i> / Reduced - found within the following pages is not to be relied upon as a primary source. There was no external fact-checking or consultation with anything or anyone before publication. This is not to preach or judge. This was a solitary effort and I am accountable for what is inside its pages.</p>

<p>The translations of words in the Glossary are by the editor and the actual words and terms should be researched and better translated within the context.</p>

<p><i>People study this subject and these rules for centuries.  This is to be studied further.</i></p>

<p>The Code of Jewish Law is written to be studied with other source documents and to find deeper meaning and origins.  When in doubt, consult a rabbi or see the original source.
